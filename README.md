A ComfyUI scene that automates the injection of data into the Attn2 Prompt Injection node

Load an example image into ComfyUI to evaluate the inputs that generated it. Don't run the scene as that will change the inputs.
If you want to see eldritch horrors run a batch of generations.

Randomly generated sequences that carry semantically independent values is injected into each available unet block

The scene also has the notes of my observations as I experimented with various things. 
Hopefully I'm not too far off the mark for what others have determined. 

The scene has value as it makes it much easier to identify what thing has impacted the output image, hopefully this can provide insight into further investigation.
